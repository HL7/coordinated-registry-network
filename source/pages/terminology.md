#### Value Sets

Currently the WHT CRN IG only uses the Value Sets published by the FHIR Specification, US Core IG, SDC IG and PRO IG. There are no additional CRN specific value sets currently. However once the data elements are finalized, there will be new value sets created as part of the IG for STU ballot.
