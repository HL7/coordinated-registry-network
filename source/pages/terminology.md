#### Value Sets

Currently the WHT CRN IG only uses the Value Sets published by the FHIR Specification, US Core IG, SDC IG and PRO IG. The CRN project will use specific value sets that already exist in LOINC and VSAC as required. These value sets are currently external to the FHIR IG and may be included in the IG in the future after piloting and obtaining feedback from pilots. Some examples of these value sets are listed below

[Women's Health Technology CRN Concomitant Procedures Performed](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1180.14/expansion)
