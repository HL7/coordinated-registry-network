In order to retrieve the AccessGUDID data the following APIs should be used: 

* The Device Lookup API [GET /devices/lookup (https://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/resources/developers/device_lookup_api)] allows users to retrieve the Manufacturer.Organization.name (returned as companyName), deviceName (retuned as brandName), and modelNumber (returned as versionModelNumber) by sending the device identifier.
* The Device SNOMED API [GET /devices/snomed (https://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/resources/developers/device_snomed_api)] allows users to retrieve the device type â€“ i.e., the SNOMED code and term by sending the device identifier.  

Note: Implementer must generate a UMLS single-use ticket to retrieve the coded value.
